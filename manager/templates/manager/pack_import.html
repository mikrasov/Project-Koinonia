Rufous Tealeaf was the firstborn of a rather large family. As the oldest, and a girl, she was expected to do many tasks around the home, and watch after her younger siblings. Although she may, at times, have felt some dissatisfaction about her lot in life, she took her responsibilities very seriously. After Whistler, it took the Tealeafs three years to have another child. That child was named Perrin, and he was the pride and joy of his parents from the day he was born. Naturally, he was quite spoiled, but Perrin had a classic halfling good disposition, and the main effect of his parent's leniency was that he had quite a high opinion of himself and was given to impulsiveness.\n\nWhen it was time for her brother to begin attending school, Whistler Rufous was tasked with his protection out in the world. The Tealeafs adored their young son's dashing nature and charming flair, so rather than cautioning him to be careful, they decided he needed a protector. \n\nAs Whistler grew (and with her Perrin and her four other young siblings), though her family life was good, things in the village began to take a turn for the worse. A local noble had died, leaving his position and lands to a son not well suited to the task of governing. Rather than assist the people in his land, this noble saw the people as simple tools in his quest for a pleasurable life. He began taxing the villagers more and more, taking more than they could afford to give.\n\nStill, children only know what they have lived, and the adults of the Halfling community protected their children from the worst realities of their situations. The Tealeaf children had plenty of fun, friends, and mischief, and grew up more or less carefree. Whistler actually had more time to play once she was tasked with her brother Perrin's safety, as she was excused from other duties so that she could be with him. And Whistler adored her very first sibling. The two grew especially close, and spent all of their time together.\n\nWhistler's devotion to her family did not mean that she didn't have dreams of her own, however, and when she came of age, Whistler declared her intention to leave the village and train as a druid in the forests of the mountain. \n\nHer parents were upset and confused. The only Tealeaf that Whistler had confided her plans to was Perrin, and the Tealeafs saw only that their helpful firstborn suddenly wished to leave the village, and that Perrin, still charming, but still impulsive, would lose his guardian. Whistler and Perrin pointed out that if Perrin began training with the rangers early, he could go out in a year on his wilderness training placement and be right next door to Whistler. \n\nUltimately, strong-willed Whistler, backed by her brother (who their parents never could deny anything), had her way and went into the wilds. She missed her brother, but felt that she was fulfilling her destined path with the druids. She learned much, and barely had time to pen the odd letter or two to her brother and family back home. \n\nBut it was not to last. On a cool spring day near the end of her training, Whistler received an urgent summons to the druid elder's lodge. Arriving out of breath, she found her brother, looking bruised and dirty, sitting to the side as one of the village rangers spoke in hushed tones with the druid council.\n\nA council member beckoned to Whistler, and she approached, the confusion and worry clear on her face. \n\n\"There has been an incident involving your brother at the village,\" the council member informed her matter-of-factly, \"and it appears that he is no longer welcome in the lands of our lord.\" He spoke the last two words with an ironic twist to his mouth, and continued on. \"Your brother must leave at once, and it seems your parents are demanding that you be released from your training to accompany him.\"","max":""},{"name":"is_npc","current":"1","max":""}],"bio":"Whistler%20Rufous%0ATealeaf%20was%20the%20firstborn%20of%20a%20rather%20large%20family.%20As%20the%20oldest%2C%0Aand%20a%20girl%2C%20she%20was%20expected%20to%20do%20many%20tasks%20around%20the%20home%2C%20and%0Awatch%20after%20her%20younger%20siblings.%20Although%20she%20may%2C%20at%20times%2C%20have%0Afelt%20some%20dissatisfaction%20about%20her%20lot%20in%20life%2C%20she%20took%20her%0Aresponsibilities%20very%20seriously.%20After%20Whistler%2C%20it%20took%20the%20Tealeafs%0Athree%20years%20to%20have%20another%20child.%20That%20child%20was%20named%20Perrin%2C%20and%0Ahe%20was%20the%20pride%20and%20joy%20of%20his%20parents%20from%20the%20day%20he%20was%20born.%0ANaturally%2C%20he%20was%20quite%20spoiled%2C%20but%20Perrin%20had%20a%20classic%20halfling%0Agood%20disposition%2C%20and%20although%20being%20spoiled%20led%20him%20to%20have%20quite%20a%0Ahigh%20opinion%20of%20himself%2C%20and%20be%20a%20trifle%20impulsive%2C%20he%20was%20still%20a%0Agood%20lad.%3Cbr%3E%0A%0A%3Cp%20style%3D%22margin-bottom%3A%200in%20%3B%20line-height%3A%20100%25%22%3EWhen%20it%20was%20time%20for%0Aher%20brother%20to%20begin%20attending%20school%2C%20Whistler%20Rufous%20was%20tasked%0Awith%20his%20protection%20out%20in%20the%20world.%20The%20Tealeafs%20adored%20their%20young%0Ason's%20dashing%20nature%20and%20charming%20flair%2C%20so%20rather%20than%20cautioning%0Ahim%20to%20be%20careful%2C%20they%20decided%20he%20needed%20a%20protector.%20%0A%3Cbr%3E%0A%0A%3C%2Fp%3E%3Cp%20style%3D%22margin-bottom%3A%200in%20%3B%20line-height%3A%20100%25%22%3EAs%20Whistler%20grew%0A(and%20with%20her%20Perrin%20and%20her%20four%20other%20young%20siblings)%2C%20though%20her%0Afamily%20life%20was%20good%2C%20things%20in%20the%20village%20began%20to%20take%20a%20turn%20for%0Athe%20worse.%20A%20local%20noble%20had%20died%2C%20leaving%20his%20position%20and%20lands%20to%0Aa%20son%20not%20well%20suited%20to%20the%20task%20of%20governing.%20Rather%20than%20assist%0Athe%20people%20in%20his%20land%2C%20this%20noble%20saw%20the%20people%20as%20simple%20tools%20in%0Ahis%20quest%20for%20a%20pleasurable%20life.%20He%20began%20taxing%20the%20villagers%20more%0Aand%20more%2C%20taking%20more%20than%20they%20could%20afford%20to%20give.%3Cbr%3E%0A%0A%3C%2Fp%3E%3Cp%20style%3D%22margin-bottom%3A%200in%20%3B%20line-height%3A%20100%25%22%3EStill%2C%20children%20only%0Aknow%20what%20they%20have%20lived%2C%20and%20the%20adults%20of%20the%20Halfling%20community%0Aprotected%20their%20children%20from%20the%20worst%20realities%20of%20their%0Asituations.%20The%20Tealeaf%20children%20had%20plenty%20of%20fun%2C%20friends%2C%20and%0Amischief%2C%20and%20grew%20up%20more%20or%20less%20carefree.%20Whistler%20actually%20had%0Amore%20time%20to%20play%20once%20she%20was%20tasked%20with%20her%20brother%20Perrin's%0Asafety%2C%20as%20she%20was%20excused%20from%20other%20duties%20so%20that%20she%20could%20be%0Awith%20him.%20And%20Whistler%20adored%20her%20very%20first%20sibling.%20The%20two%20grew%0Aespecially%20close%2C%20and%20spent%20all%20of%20their%20time%20together.%3Cbr%3E%0A%0A%3C%2Fp%3E%3Cp%20style%3D%22margin-bottom%3A%200in%20%3B%20line-height%3A%20100%25%22%3EWhistler's%20devotion%0Ato%20her%20family%20did%20not%20mean%20that%20she%20didn't%20have%20dreams%20of%20her%20own%2C%0Ahowever%2C%20and%20when%20she%20came%20of%20age%2C%20Whistler%20declared%20her%20intention%20to%0Aleave%20the%20village%20and%20train%20as%20a%20druid%20in%20the%20forests%20of%20the%0Amountain.%20%0A%3Cbr%3E%0A%0A%3C%2Fp%3E%3Cp%20style%3D%22margin-bottom%3A%200in%20%3B%20line-height%3A%20100%25%22%3EHer%20parents%20were%0Aupset%20and%20confused.%20The%20only%20Tealeaf%20that%20Whistler%20had%20confided%20her%0Aplans%20to%20was%20Perrin%2C%20and%20the%20Tealeafs%20saw%20only%20that%20their%20helpful%0Afirstborn%20suddenly%20wished%20to%20leave%20the%20village%2C%20and%20that%20Perrin%2C%0Astill%20charming%2C%20but%20still%20impulsive%2C%20would%20lose%20his%20guardian.%0AWhistler%20and%20Perrin%20pointed%20out%20that%20if%20Perrin%20began%20training%20with%0Athe%20rangers%20early%2C%20he%20could%20go%20out%20in%20a%20year%20on%20his%20wilderness%0Atraining%20placement%20and%20be%20right%20next%20door%20to%20Whistler.%20%0A%3Cbr%3E%0A%0A%3C%2Fp%3E%3Cp%20style%3D%22margin-bottom%3A%200in%20%3B%20line-height%3A%20100%25%22%3EUltimately%2C%0Astrong-willed%20Whistler%2C%20backed%20by%20her%20brother%20(who%20their%20parents%0Anever%20could%20deny%20anything)%2C%20had%20her%20way%20and%20went%20into%20the%20wilds.%20She%0Amissed%20her%20brother%2C%20but%20felt%20that%20she%20was%20fulfilling%20her%20destined%0Apath%20with%20the%20druids.%20She%20learned%20much%2C%20and%20barely%20had%20time%20to%20pen%0Athe%20odd%20letter%20or%20two%20to%20her%20brother%20and%20family%20back%20home.%20%0A%3Cbr%3E%0A%0A%3C%2Fp%3E%3Cp%20style%3D%22margin-bottom%3A%200in%20%3B%20line-height%3A%20100%25%22%3EBut%20it%20was%20not%20to%0Alast.%20On%20a%20cool%20spring%
